### ddRADseq

Streptavidin bead cleaning of P1-P1 primer pairs

Do I need to remove DNA from beads prior to PCR? ddRAD protocol is vague on this...

According to [Life Sciences FAQ](http://www.lifetechnologies.com/us/en/home/brands/product-brand/dynal/streptavidin-coupled-dynabeads/dynabeads-streptavidin.html#9), No:

> Can the Streptavidin-Coupled Dynabeads® be used directly in a PCR reaction?
> 
> Yes, the beads can be used directly in PCR, as they do not inhibit enzymatic reaction. Slight PCR-inhibition has been seen when 75–100 µg of Dynabeads® M-280 Streptavidin was used in 50 µL PCR reaction, and a concentration over 100 µg per 50 µL reaction seems to inhibit PCR completely. Dynabeads® M-270 Streptavidin do not show any inhibitory effect on PCR at these concentrations.

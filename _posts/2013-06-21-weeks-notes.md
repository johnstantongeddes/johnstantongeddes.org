## 2013-06-17

Finished P-value commentary with Cintia and Cristian! Sent to Ecology for review.

Useful discussion of the [bias-variance tradeoff and Random Forests](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html)


#### Github

Working on protocol for using git/github.

Note that git does not show empty directories in `git status`. Add a README.md file to each directory to get around this.

If you accidentaly add a file that you do not want to track, use `git rm --cached FILENAME` to remove from version control

To show all branches, including remote use `git branch -a`

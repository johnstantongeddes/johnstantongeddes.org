Brief summary of the tasks and work I accomplished this calendar year. Broady organized along NSF grant proposal criteria.

## Teaching

* Taught in Citizen Science program at Bard College
* Guest lectures in Exploring Biology, Human Genetics and Population Genetics courses at UVM

## Research

* Started postdoc at UVM on Dimensions of Biodiversity project in February 
* Set up and administer antlab workstation with 18 bioinformatics programs software packages for 12 users
* Aphaenogaster transcriptome (ApTranscriptome)
    - designed experiment and [collected data](http://johnstantongeddes.org/ecological%20genetics/2013/03/21/thursday.html)
    - preliminary data analysis done and manuscript draft in progress (~50%)
* Aphaenogaster adaptive evolution of gene expression by latitude (ApGXL)
    - coordinated permits and collection of *Aphaenogaster* colonies from about 30 sites from Pennyslvania to Maine. Collected Aphaenogaster from 3 sites in NY and VT
    - coordinated Phytotron experiment with NCSU
    - Designed [protocol](http://johnstantongeddes.org/apgxl/2013/09/04/ApGXL-heat-shock-protocol.html) and collected first set of *Aphaenogaster* samples for RNAseq from Phytotron 
    - Planned and ordered materials for digital gene expression (DGE) tag analysis of Phytotron samples
* Aphaenogaster adaptive potential (ApAdaPt)
    - designed experiment
    - collected 50 colonies at Harvard Forest and collected first year of data
* Created pipeline for [simulated transcriptome assembly](https://github.com/johnstantongeddes/sim-transcriptome)
* Planned and ordered materials for ddRADseq of *Aphaenogaster* samples for population genetics
* Planning and DNA isolation for *Aphaenogaster* genome sequencing
* Paper (in press) *In defense of P-values: comment on the statistical methods actually used by ecologists* with Cristian Dambros and Cintia Gomez de Freitas
* Papers officially published:
    - [Candidate Genes and Genetic Architecture of Symbiotic and Agronomic Traits Revealed by Whole-Genome, Sequence-Based Association Genetics in Medicago truncatula](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0065688)
    - [Estimating heritability using genomic data](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12129/abstract)
* Attended and presented at Aphaenofest
* Attended Gordon Conference on Ecological and Evolutionary Genomics

## Broader Impacts

* Completed [8 reviews]({% post_url 2013-07-10-reviews %}) for 7 different journals.
* Started [open lab notebook](http://johnstantongeddes.org/labnotebook.html) consisting of 135 entries with a total of 54,407 words since [first entry]({% post_url 2013-03-13-first-post %}).
* Started [GotelliLab](https://github.com/GotelliLab) github account.
* Coordinated new Q & A feature for the [Molecular Ecologist blog](http://www.molecularecologist.com/) featuring [Loren Rieseberg, Ruth Shaw and Richard Lenski](http://www.molecularecologist.com/author/johnstantongeddes/).

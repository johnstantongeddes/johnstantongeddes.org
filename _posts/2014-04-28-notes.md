* From Twitter, Joe Felsenstein's [pictures of population geneticists 1960-70](https://www.flickr.com/photos/123558304@N02/sets/72157644164299043)
* [GNU Parallel](https://www.biostars.org/p/63816/) + [BAS](http://jermdemo.blogspot.com/2011/06/big-ass-servers-and-myths-of-clusters.html) [cluster](https://www.xsede.org/iu-mason) = AWESOME. A BLAST job that previuosly required
    - splitting FASTA file into 18 parts
    - creating PBS to run BLAST for each part
    - combining results

is now completed with a *single* script in 3 hrs 15 min using 407 GB RAM!

    - tradeoff between time and memory  

* Biology seminar
* Prediction symposium
* Reading up on random effects ASTER models

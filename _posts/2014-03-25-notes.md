Molecular Ecologist Q&A with [Charles Goodnight](http://www.molecularecologist.com/2014/03/people-behind-the-science-dr-charles-goodnight/#more-4014) posted.


### ApTranscriptome

Working on analysis


## ddRADseq

Bioanalyzer results - no DNA

Qubit - no DNA

Shit. Tomorrow begins trouble-shooting...


### Reading

Murren, C.J., Maclean, H.J., Diamond, S.E., Steiner, U.K., Heskel, M.A., Handelsman, C.A., Ghalambor, C.K., Auld, J.R., Callahan, H.S., Pfennig, D.W., Relyea, R.A., Schlichting, Carl D. & Kingsolver, J. (2014). Evolutionary Change in Continuous Reaction Norms. The American Naturalist, 183, 453â€“467.

  - metaanalysis of continuous reaction norms
  - compare *mean* and *shape* of reaction norms among species and/or populations
    * offset: overall difference in mean treat value across all environments
    * slope: difference in overall slope
    * curvature: average difference in curvature of the reaction norm
    * wiggle: variability in shape not captured by previous three measures
  - total of 3,079 contrast lines examined including six moderator variables
  - differences in slope + curvature + wiggle greater than differences in offset
  - offset greater for biotic interactions than abiotic factors
  - greater differences in reaction norms between species than populations
  - "results suggest that microevolutionary changes in curvature and higher-order shape (Wiggle) may be more evolutionary variable than simpler (first-order) aspects of the reaction norm such as slope"
  - "two-environment studies may underestimate the extent of evolutionary change"
  - divergence greater in novel environments; maybe indicative of 'hidden' plasticity
  - Overall, interesting analysis with important results
  - Many aspects useful for interpretation of thermal reactionome!

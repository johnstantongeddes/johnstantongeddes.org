### Pooling and size selection

- Pooled all remaining ligated sample *without* AMPure bead purification
- Ran on 1.5% agarose gel for 3 hours
  - still no DNA visible in sample lane when I visualize gel

- Excised gel fragments for 275, 375 and 475 bp +- 25bp
- QIAquick gel purification

DNA concentration from Qubit

Sample        Stock conc (ng/ul)      Total DNA (ng)
---------    --------------------    ------------------
P                    8.78                351.2
P-200                0.055                 0.5
P-300                0.066                 0.6
P-400                0                     0

Total DNA is in 40 ul for sample P and 10 ul for P-200, P-300 and P-400

Key points:

* DNA is lost during AMPure purification step during pooling
* From Bioanalyzer, expect about 10% of DNA to be in the 200 bp window, so could maximally recover about 8 ng, yet recover less than 1. So, even the gel purification is problematic.

Seems that I need more input DNA...though I'm using within recommended range (100 - 500 ng) from ddRADseq protocol. What gives??

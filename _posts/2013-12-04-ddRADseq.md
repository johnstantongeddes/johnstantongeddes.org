To select best enzyme combination for double digest RADseq (ddRAD), we need to estimate the number of fragments generated by digestion using combination of restriction enzymes. As an *Aphaenogaster* genome isn't available, we are using the [*Pogonomyrmex barbatus*](http://www.antgenomes.org/downloads/) as the closest reference. Note that Table 1 of the ddRADseq [paper](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0037135#s5) also reports simulated fragment recovery for *Solenopsis invicta*, *Apis mellifera* and *Drosophila melanogaster*.

**Method**: *in silico* digest using code suggested on [seqanswers](http://seqanswers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=35110):

    cat pbar_scaffolds_v03.fasta | tr -d "\n" | grep -o -E "CCGG.{264,336}CCGG" | wc -l

where `pbar_scaffolds_v03.fasta` is the target genome fasta file, and `CCGG` is replaced the forward and reverse restriction enzyme recognition sequence, respectively. The fragment size selected `{264,336}` is based on the 'wide' size selection simulation of Peterson et al. (2012).

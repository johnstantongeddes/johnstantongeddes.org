### Computing

Working on getting set-up with Amazon EC2 - roughly following this [great step-by-step guide](http://www.broadinstitute.org/~gymrek/AWS_tutorial/BARC_mgymrek_cloud_tutorial.pdf)!

Looking into using [CloudBioLinux](https://github.com/chapmanb/cloudbiolinux) machine image so most bioinformatics programs are loaded.

Next up - setting up a Docker container to run transcriptome analysis!

Good place to start is [Docker for ROpenSci](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/cboettig/rstudio/)

### Samples

DNA was extracted from 3 ants each from 6 lab colonies of *Aphaenogaster*. 

```{r table1, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
sample <- c("T1", "T2", "T3", "T4", "T5", "T6")
colony <- c("EW205", "EW110", "2012A1", "DG23", "20130818-Mike", "EW20 QR")
conc_extraction <- c(42.4, 60, 29.1, 58, 34.9, 35.2)
total_dna <- conc_extraction*40

table1 <- cbind(sample, colony, conc_extraction, total_dna)
pandoc.table(table1, caption = "DNA concentration (ng/ul) and total mass in 40 ul", style = "rmarkdown")
```

Combined total DNA ~ `r round(sum(total_dna), 0)` ng 

### Double digestion

50 ul rxn volume following NEB protocol 

Reagent           Volume (ul)
---------        -------------
NlaIII                 1
MluCl                  1
DNA                   40   
CutSmart Buffer        5
H~2~O                  4 

<br>

3 hr digestion at 37Â°C.

Included "T7" Control sample of dH~2~O only.

* Ln 1, Ap001, is genomic DNA. Note smear above largest marker and no/very little DNA within assay range.

* Ln 2 - 6 are double-digested samples. Looks like digest worked well for all samples as concentration in the 180 - 220 bp window ranged from 0.84 - 3.64 ng/ul. 


### AMPure Bead Purification

- added 75 ul AMPure Beads to the 50 ul rxn. Incubated 5 min room temp
- 2 min on magnetic plate. removed solution
- added 200 ul 70% ethanol (fresh). removed. repeat
- off plate, added 40 ul H~2~O. 1 min
- on plate 2 min. transfered solution to new plate

Quantified DNA using Qubit.

```{r table2, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
sample <- c("T1", "T2", "T3", "T4", "T5", "T6", "T7")
conc_extraction <- c(42.4, 60, 29.1, 58, 34.9, 35.2, NA)
conc_digestion <- c(10.9, 24.5, 5.19, 10.2, 5.82, 2.1, 0.13)

table2 <- cbind(sample, conc_extraction, conc_digestion)
pandoc.table(table2, caption = "DNA concentration (ng/ul) of samples after DNA extraction and after double digestion", style = "rmarkdown")
```

<br>

* DNA recovery is low, only `r mean(conc_digestion[1:6]/conc_extraction[1:6]) * 100`% on average.
* Positive correlation between the input DNA and DNA after digestion.
* T7 is the blank control - note low-level DNA contamination. 

```{r digestion_cor, echo=FALSE} 
cor.test(conc_extraction[1:6], conc_digestion[1:6])
png("../assets/figure/digestion_cor.png")
plot(conc_extraction[1:6], conc_digestion[1:6], xlab = "Conc. of samples after extraction (ng/ul)", ylab = "Conc. of samples after digestion (ng/ul)")
dev.off()
```

**Ligation**

Input 100 ng total DNA from each sample for ligation. Volume of each sample to use as input for ligation reaction:

Sample        Volume DNA (ul)      
--------    --------------  
T1               9.2 
T2               4.0 
T3              19.3 
T4               9.8  
T5              17.2  
T6              47.6  
T7              40.0 

<br>

For each sample, combined DNA with adapter and T4 ligase. Determined concentration of adapters using [ligation molarity calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ar5IymziRJ_9dEtyYzRfd0cteDc1cEM1ekN5M1doZEE&usp=drive_web#gid=0). Made fresh working stock of the universal adapter P2. Rather than make a working stock for each adapter P1, just used 0.5 ul of adapters P1.1 - P1.7 for samples T1 - T7, respectively. Made master mix of universal adapter P2 following worksheet.

Reagent         Volume (ul)
----------     -------------              
DNA               see above
T4 mix            4
P1 (4uM)             0.5
P2 mix               3
H~2~O             to 50 ul

```{r table3, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
sample <- c("T1", "T2", "T3", "T4", "T5", "T6", "T7")
bioan_digestion <- c(0.32, 2.9, 1.5, 0.9, 1.4, 0.7, NA)
bioan_ligation <- c(1.12, 0.28, 0.07, 1.78, 0.99, 5, 1.7)

table3 <- cbind(sample, "Digestion conc" = bioan_digestion, "Ligation conc" = bioan_ligation)

pandoc.table(table3, caption = "DNA concentration (ng/ul) of samples after DNA extraction and after double digestion.", style = "rmarkdown")
```

No correlation between Bioanalyzer concentrations for samples before and after ligation. 

```{r ligation_cor, echo = FALSE} 
cor.test(bioan_digestion[1:6], bioan_ligation[1:6])
png("../assets/figure/ligation_cor.png")
plot(bioan_digestion[1:6], bioan_ligation[1:6], ylab = "Conc. of samples after ligation (ng/ul)", xlab = "Conc. of samples after digestion (ng/ul)")
dev.off()
```

### Size selection

* Pooled 40 ul of each ligation in single 1.5 ml tube, leaving ~ 10 ul for diagnostics.
* AMPure bead purification - modified rack method using 96-well magnet plate
  - Total pool volume 320 ul. 
  - 480 ul AMPure beads
  - Two washes with 500 ul 70% EtOH
  - Eluted in 30 ul H~2~O
* Size selection
  - ran gel for 2.5 hrs at 120V.
  - To size select (1) 200+-20 bp, (2) 300+-20 bp, (3) 400 +- 20bp, had to account for 76 bp of adapter sequence. Cut gel pieces 250 - 300 bp, 350 - 400 bp, 450 - 500 bp
  
#![Diagram of gel size selection. Dotted boxes show gel slices cut for size selection.]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/gel_size_selection.png)

  - QIAquick purification, eluting in 12 ul H~2~O

```{r table4, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
Sample <- c("P1", "P2", "P3")
descrip <- c("Pooled - size 200", "Pooled - size 300", "Pooled -size 400")
bioan_conc <- c(0.18, 0, 0.01)

table4 <- cbind(Sample, descrip, Conc = bioan_conc)

pandoc.table(table4, caption = "DNA concentration (ng/ul) of pooled samples for different gel size extractions.", style = "rmarkdown")
```

<br>

**Very little to no DNA in each pooled size selection.**

Possible places DNA lost

* pooling
* gel extraction

### ApTranscriptome

Continuing from yesterday, spent much of day trying to use `lmrob` function for robust regression. Constant string of problems. Discussed with NG and one issue is that methods are best applied to large data sets, so doesn't really make sense to use with *only* 22 points. Advantage of OLS is that it can nearly always fit a model. Simpler, and often robust, approach is to simply fit model with *log* transformed response variable. Use `log(TPM+1)` to deal with 0 values.

Power of `git` - checkout out old branch, removing all the `lmrob` code, and re-committed as HEAD of my *master* branch. 

In the process of working on this, learned some useful tips for `plyr`:

- add progress bar to see status of function
    
     .progress = "text"

- get information for debugging on which piece of dataset problems are occuring using `.inform` [from stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1395622/debugging-lapply-sapply-calls)

    .inform = TRUE

Protocol to extract high-molecular weight DNA using [Qiagen Genomic-tip Midi Kit](http://www.qiagen.com/products/catalog/sample-technologies/dna-sample-technologies/genomic-dna/blood-and-cell-culture-dna-midi-kit). Note that using the "Tissue" prep with only Buffer G2 for homogenization and lysis [did not work]({% post_url 2013-11-07-genomic-tip-success %}) and a cell lysis buffer (I use the [Buffer ATL](http://www.qiagen.com/products/catalog/lab-essentials-and-accessories/buffer-atl) supplied with the DNeasy kits) is necessary. 

Tested for *Pogonomyrmex* and *Aphaenogaster* ants. 

Protocol below is for 20 ants in 10 screw cap tubes. Modify for more or fewer.

**Tissue homogenization and cell lysis**

1) Flash freeze ants in 2ml screw-cap tubes, up to 2 *Pogo* or 3 *Aphaenogaster* per tube. 
2) Add 500ul Buffer ATL to each tube. *Pogos* need to be crushed with pestle due to hard exoskeleton.
3) Add one scoop zirconium silicate beads ([Quackenbush](http://www.quackco.com/qbzirc.htm)) to each tube. Blend for 4 minutes at top speed in Bullet Blender ([Next Advance](http://www.nextadvance.com/api/Index.cfm/products.info/c/421/Bullet-Blender)).
4) Centrifuge for 2 minutes at 10k rpm.
5) Transfer supernatant from each tube to a *single* new 15ml conical tube using a pipettor (P200 then P20). Avoid transferring cell debris. Add 5 ml of Buffer G2. 
6) Add 500 ul Proteinase K.
7) Incubate overnight at 50C.

**DNA purification**

Following standard Qiagen Genomic-tip protocol.

8) Equilibrate Genomic-tip with 4 ml Buffer QBT. Allow all buffer to flow through.
  - Take 300ul aliquot of sample and save for analytical gel (aliquot 1).
9) Vortex sample 10 seconds. Pour onto Genomic-tip.
  - Take 300 ul aliquot of flow-through (aliquot 2)
10) Wash twice with 5 ml Buffer QC.
  - Take 600 ul aliquot of flow-through (aliquot 3)
11) Place Genomic-tip over 15 ml glass tube for Sorval centrifuge. Elute DNA with 5 ml Buffer QF.
  - Take 300 ul aliqot of flow-through (aliquot 4 - should contain DNA!)
12) Precipitate DNA by adding 3.5 ml isopropanol. Mix. Centrifuge for 15 minutes at > 8,000G at 4C (Sorval refrigerated centrigure).
13) Carefully pour off isopropanol supernatant. Add 2 ml cold 70% ethanol. Centrifuge for 10 min at > 8,000G at 4C.
14) Pour of ethanol. Air-dry.
15) Resuspend DNA in 500 ul buffer overnight.

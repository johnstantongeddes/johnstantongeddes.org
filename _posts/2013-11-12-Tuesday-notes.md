### ApGenome

Sample had substantial amount of precipitate in bottom of tube after overnight incubation. 

* 100ul aliquot of sample
* Warm 5 ml Buffer QF to 50C to increase elution
* Equilibrated Genomic-tip with 4 ml Buffer QBT
* Vortexed sample and added to Genomic-tip
  - only about half went through before flow stopped.
  - pulled off remaining sample, transferred to 1.5 ml eppendorfs and centrifuged for 1 min. even more white precipitate in bottom of tubes.
  - decided to start new Genomic-tip with remaining sample (supernatant after centrifuging). *still* stopped up with centrifuged sample (only about 3ml). pulled the sample that was 'stuck' as aliquot A1-A. Proceed.
* Wash twice with 7.5 ml Buffer QC
* Elute into glass centrifuge tube with 5 ml Buffer QBT warmed to 50C
* Add 3.5 ml isopropanol. Mix.
  - *very* clear DNA precipitation!! *lots* in the first tube and still plenty visible in second
* Centrifuge 15 min 10k G at 4C. Pour off supernatant.
* Add 2 ml cold 70% ethanol. Centrifuge 10 min 10K G at 4C. Pour off supernatant.
* Allow to completely dry. Re-hydrate DNA in 500ul Buffer AE from DNeasy kit per recommendation from Delaware Sequencing Center. 

NOTE: update protocol to *not* combine homogenized samples for incubation with Proteinase K.
Instead, transfer supernatant to new 1.5ml centrifuge tube, add 1 ml Buffer G2 to tube with 50 ul Proteinase K and incubate tubes overnight in heat block. 
Would be possible to use 15 ml conical if large centrifuge convenient.
After incubation, centrifuge tubes. Pool supernatant to apply to Genomic-tip.
Need to add RNAse A incubation, 15 min at 37C, prior to applying sample to Genomic-tip. 

Nanodrop results. Pog20131111-a is the second Genomic-tip with sample that didn't flow-through first tip

Sample              ng/ul     260:280
----------------  --------   ----------
Pog20131111          55.9       1.48
Pog20131111-a        60.10      1.55
--------------------------------------

Awesome!!! High mass and decent quality DNA. Interesting that the second sample had slighly higher mass and quality, suggesting that I overloaded the Genomic-tip. May want to split and dilute future samples.


### Teaching

Covering BCOR 11 and Population Genetics classes for Heather on Friday and Monday. Discussed topics to cover. 

**BCOR**

*Friday*

* Review transcript to translation (Campbell Ch. 17) - the 'Central Dogma'
* Post-translational modification (Campbell Ch. 17)
  - translated gene is a polypeptide, needs to be modified to become functional
  - folding (paper airplane example)
  - chaperones
  - signaling peptides
* Kuru video - prion disease
  - discuss cause (genetic?) 
  - epidemiology
* Begin Chapter 18: gene expression
  - what is a gene?

*Monday*

* Gene expression (Campbell Ch. 18) 
  - lac operon
  - trp operon
* Summary of my research on current methods to examine gene expression in non-model systems

### Open science

Another pre-eminent scholar that [signs reviews](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/metascience/journals/tracz-interview-f100research-2013.html)

### Human genetics

Some ideas for a 'motivating example' for the "Alleles changing" lecture I will be covering in Amanda Yonin's Human Genetics course on Oct 25th.

Combine this paper on [rapid increase in rare variants](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1003815) with a discussion of [Mendelian disease in this population](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.genom.2.1.69?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed) using this [case study](http://sciencecases.lib.buffalo.edu/cs/collection/detail.asp?case_id=417&id=417)

### ApTranscriptome

Turning `sim-transcriptome.sh` into a script that can be run with fasta file of known transcripts as input, and output including

- assembly stats for all reads
- assembly stats for normalized reads
- gene expression counts of reads on known transcripts
- gene expression counts of reads on assembled transcripts

#### Assembly ####

Surprising result that velvet-oases assembly with *all* reads results in fewer contigs of shorter length than assembly with normalized reads. Why would this be???

#### Gene Expression ####

**Tophat-cufflinks**

Parial explanation to (problem before)({% post_url 2013-10-09-more-simulation-notes %}) where only ~29 of 100 transcripts actually had gene expression counts - low read mapping to assembled transcripts.

1) map reads to *known* transcripts
  - FPKM for 97 transcripts

2) map reads to *assembled* transcripts
  - FPKM for 31 transcripts

Could be because of lots of multiple alignment to the assembled transcripts vs the known transcripts.

For tophat mapped reads to assembled transcripts:

But, the correlation of expression counts from cufflinks mapped to known transcripts is beautiful! r=0.83 for 97 of 100 transcripts!

Similar problem with BWA...what to do with *real* data where I can't infer incorrect isoforms?

## Aphaenogaster

Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 $3,350 for 48 samples, ~$70/sample.

12 hours prep time. Cost calculation: 

Item                     Cost/sample
-------                  --------------
DGE                        120
Encore Rapid Library       70
BMGC sequencing            202
Bioanalyzer                2.5
TOTAL                      394.5
-----------------------------------------

With sequencing cost at $3227/lane, 16 samples per lane

compare to estimates for the Encore Rapid:


Item                     Cost/sample
-------                  --------------
DGE                        120
Encore Rapid Library       35
BMGC sequencing            202
KAPPA qPCR                 21
TOTAL                      378
-----------------------------------------

So comparable of cheaper to use NuGEN. Spoke with Kappa Biosystems rep - after initial runs with qPCR of 4 dilutions/20ul volume/3 replicates could try reducing to 2 dilutions so each kit would work for twice as many samples, further reducing cost.

## Lab Notebook

Last week placed first image in a post, but couldn't get it to appear. Ran into a similar problem with locating my css files when originally setting up jekyll so will document here as this is a major problem with jekyll. 

Problem: Need absolute path to get to some resources (css, image files) as otherwise jekyll looks for resources relative to the current page/post. 

For css files, I used the second solution proposed by kikito on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7985081/how-to-deploy-a-jekyll-site-locally-with-css-js-and-background-images-included). Add an optional setting called `root` on each page with `..\` to go up levels to the root directory of the website. For example, for a post page I need to go up four levels - from date to month to year to categories to main page, so I assign `root: "../../../../"`

Then inside my head.html file in the _includes folder I include the code to set the page root as specified on stackoverflow.

For example, for a post page I need to go up four levels - from date to month to year to categories to main page, so I assign `root: "../../../../"`

However, this didn't work for my images on a posts page.  Using `![samtools pileup tview]({{ page.root }}images/samtools-tview.png "pileup view")` the image failed to display and the jekyll generated source html showed `<img src="images/samtools-tview.png" title="pileup view" alt="samtools pileup tview"><figcaption>samtools pileup tview</figcaption>`.

By adding a root to the post `root: ../../../../` the jekyll generated html was correct: `<img src="../../../../images/samtools-tview.png" title="pileup view" alt="samtools pileup tview"><figcaption>samtools pileup tview</figcaption>`

Note that this time there are NOT parentheses about the root, though I did use them i n the posts.html layout. Apparently I'm missing some subtlety here...but whatever works!

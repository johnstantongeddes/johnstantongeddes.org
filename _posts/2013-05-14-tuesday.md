Aphaenogaster transcriptome assembly.

(Re)read the Oases paper and manual. 

## Antlab

Installed newest version of [velvet](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/velvet/) and [oases](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/oases/). 

As we will have reads up to 100bp, set MAXKMERLENGTH=66 for both velvet and oases as I somewhere recall seeing that max kmer should be about 2/3 length of reads. Will be getting 100bp reads. 

Did some reading on best practices for [software installation in linux](http://askubuntu.com/questions/65728/where-to-install-software-and-executables-for-all-users) so that programs will be available to all users.
Cloned programs `git clone git://github.com/dzerbino/velvet.git` into /opt/software. Ran `make` and then symbolically linked `ln -s \opt\software\velvet\velveth` into \usr\local\bin so that the programs are available to all users.

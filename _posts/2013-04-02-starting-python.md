## Aphaenogaster

Still working on permits. Received for Maine and NH, still need to get them for MA, NY and PA...

## Bradyrhizobium

Moving from Galaxy to command-line for genome assembly so I have more control over the data and workflow.

Started to use BioPython!  Back at the beginning of the learning curve for programming.

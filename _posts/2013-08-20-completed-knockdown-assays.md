Total of 339 ants.

### Climate Cascade group meeting

1) Aphaenogaster samples
  - ![Map of locations]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/Aphaenogaster-sampling-locations.png)
2) Phytotron update
  - One colony from each site at 20C and 26C
  - Colonies seem to be okay with reduced ramp to +-1.5C daily
  - Transferred to Phytotron from July 9th to 25th, with replacement colonies added July 29th

SCH: I should go down and help with protocol for first round of sample collection for gene expression
Samples to collect:

* 8 ants heat-shocked at 37C for one hour, flash frozen for gene expression
* 8 ants control temp for one hour, flash frozen for gene expression
* 10 ants (2 sets of 5) for protein stability (Andrew)
* 3 ants for cuticular hydrocarbons (Mike) frozen 
* Lacy will be doing CTmax on 10 ants per sample
* Total: 39 ants. This will substantially reduce small colonies.

3) Transcriptome update

  - JSG: preliminary pipeline including *in silico* spike-in nearly done

4) Genome plans
  - 1 lane Illumina 200bp fragment library (160 million 100bp paired-end reads) ~ $3k
  - ~90x coverage assuming 350Mbp genome size
  - 1 lane Illumina 3kbp jump library 
  - ALLPATHS-LG assembly
  - BioNano physical mapping ~$5k

5) Adaptive Potential experiment

### ApTranscriptome

Rmarkdown script running through digital normalization - assembly in queue!  

Great use of caching to make a single script, without having to re-run the many hours long read processing steps...

### ApGenome

Sequencing center okay with column extraction if can show that fragment size is greater than 25kb. Need to get high molecular weight ladder to see this on gel. [NEB Low Range PFG Marker](https://www.neb.com/products/n0350-low-range-pfg-marker)?

### climate-cascade

Discussion of future papers and authorship...

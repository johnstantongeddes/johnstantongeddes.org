### CCThermBe

Heat shocked 'blue' ants.

### ddRADseq

Started trial ddRADseq library prep using 12 expendable *Aphaenogaster* samples that Nicole extracted last week - 3 ants from each colony. 

Measured concentration using Qubit.

Sample       Colony            ng/mL    Total DNA (ng)
-------     ----------        -------  ----------------
1             EW205             424        1696 
2             EW110            >600        2400
3             2012A1            291        1164
4             DG23              580        2320
5             20130818-Mike     349        1396
6             EW20 QR           352        1408
------------------------------------------------------

Total DNA is for stock = Qubit sample nb/mL * 100 * (1/1000 ul) * 40 ul

Combined Total DNA = 8 ug

For 'real' library would pool 24 - 48 samples, here only using 6 so used all DNA from each sample to ensure large volume of DNA in pooled sample for size selection and purification steps. 

**Double digest**

50 ul rxn volume following NEB protocol 

Reagent           Volume (ul)
---------        -------------
NlaIII                 1
MluCl                  1
DNA                   40   
CutSmart Buffer        5
H~2~O                  4 

3 hr digestion at 37Â°C.

Included "C" Control sample of dH~2~O only. 

Sent 2ul aliquot of each sample for Bioanalyer analysis of cutting efficiency.

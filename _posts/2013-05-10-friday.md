Meeting on Wednesday with Joel Parker, Skyler Resendez (SUNY Plattsburgh), SHC, NG, AN, JSG, Kerri Pinder to discuss summer REU research plans

Meeting on Thursday with NG, SCH and AN. Andrew presented results of qPCR for heat shock genes, comparing between static and ramp heat shock. Discussed in relevance to results in literature and experimental design for our study.

------------------------------

Finally, a [bioRxiv](http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v19/n5/full/nm0513-512.html) is on the way!  

And a note about long-term maintenance of code on github by the PI or journal forking the repository from [Casey Bergman](http://caseybergman.wordpress.com/2012/11/08/on-the-preservation-of-published-bioinformatics-code-on-github/) and ["N reasons to do computational biology"](http://caseybergman.wordpress.com/2012/07/31/top-n-reasons-to-do-a-ph-d-or-post-doc-in-bioinformaticscomputational-biology/)

## Aphaenogaster

Email from BMGC saying that samples are loaded on machine and will be done May 24.

## Medicago

Todo for manuscript

  - histogram showing distribution of relatedness values
  - heatplot showing relatedness among lines to demonstrate that we are working with individuals that have a range of relatedness (address reviewer 2)
  - include citations on genomic prediction, and explain why what we're doing is different
  - present regression intercept/slope of r on H2gcta and discuss bias
  - discuss issue of applying to inbred plant population vs outbred human population
  - discuss relevance to application in natural populations

MAYBE

  - perform analysis with subsample of lines (100, 125, 150, 175, 200) and predict for remaining lines (as in Ober 2012)

## Computer
 
Add xrandr settings to /etc/profile so second monitor resolution is persistent

 	xrandr --newmode "1440x900_59.90" 106.29 1440 1520 1672 1904 900 901 904 932 -HSync +Vsync
    xrandr --addmode DP1 1440x900_59.90
	xrandr --output DP1 --mode 1440x900_59.90

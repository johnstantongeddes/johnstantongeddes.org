- Collected 4 large Aphaenogaster picea colonies from Molly Bog (VT) with Grace Cosgrove. Goal of collection was to get **lots** of biological material for genomic DNA extraction for PacBio sequencing.
- Helped Grace set up another experimental colony for Pogo foraging behavior

- emails and such
- Ran gel of Gentra Puregene genomic DNA extraction done by 
- Awesome [website](http://sra.dnanexus.com/) for searching short read archive (SRA).
- Reviews and comments on manuscripts

- Uploaded Evolution presentation, without Alex Wild photo, to [figshare](http://figshare.com/articles/Patterns_of_thermal_stress_tolerance_vs_resistance_in_genome_wide_expression_data_of_parapatric_ant_species/1115061)
  - Stanton-Geddes, John (2014): Patterns of thermal stress tolerance vs. resistance in genome-wide expression data of parapatric ant species. figshare. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1115061. Retrieved 14:05, Jul 23, 2014 (GMT)
- Tried out [Dataverse beta](http://dataverse-demo.iq.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml;jsessionid=f08f505495394fd2001a30149589?id=582&versionId=169) with same presentation. From my exploring, it appears that the Dataverse is an open-source framework for data archiving. They provide the software for installation, and any group or organization can initiate their own Dataverse. For example, the [Harvard Election Data Archive](http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/eda/data) and the [Harvard Dataverse Network](http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/eda/data), which appears to be the motivating network for the Dataverse and the largest repository for social science. 
  - Advantages
    - open source
    - if an instance of dataverse goes defunct, information and data could (in theory) be transferred to a new instance
  - Disadvantages
    - still in development and lags behind figshare, dryad
    - not widely used outside of Harvard or social sciences
    - organizational inertia: who should initiate and manage a Dataverse for each field? 
- From Dataverse, (re)found the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/) which looks like a very powerful way to organize large collaborative projects
- Comments on Yun Kang's Medicago ms
- Review for AmNat
- Learned how to use VCC's Covaris sonicator for DNA fragmentation
  - need to experiment with different times to determine appropriate time for fragmentation. check by sending sample to bioanalyzer.


## 2014-07-24

- Completed comments for Yun's Medicago manuscript
- Finished AmNat review
- Following up on yesterday's notes about Dataverse, maybe the solution is [Academic Torrents](http://academictorrents.com/) for distributed archiving of datasets!
- Set up antlab workstation to backup to ecosim in Gotelli lab.

## 2014-07-25

- preparing for DGE prep next week. setting up lab space and checking reagents.
- ordered 
  - RNAClean XP beads
  - Qubit RNA assay
  - Covaris tubes for DNA fragmentation
- extracted from 8 samples using RNAzol as previous [trials]({% post_url 2014-01-20-Monday-notes %}) showed this give RNA with same quality as RNeasy, alone or after RNAzol
  - eluted in 22 ul
  - sent samples to Bioanalyzer to get RIN scores

Visiting the [Dunn lab](http://robdunnlab.com/) at NCSU to collect Aphaenogaster samples from the Phytotron for gene expression analysis. While discussing my [ongoing]({% post_url 2013-08-21-wednesday-notes %}) [work]({% post_url 2013-08-22-transcriptome-simulation %}) [to](({% post_url 2013-08-23-transcriptome-simulation-2 %})) assemble the transcriptome of Aphaenogaster and look for genes (pathways) that are differentially expressed along a thermal gradient, Rob said something along the lines of

Not one to turn down a bet, I suggested beer. Here's my offering if we *do* find that immunity genes are involved: [Heady Topper](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/27039/16814).

Anyone else want to bet?

## Transcriptomics

Sara pointed me to Hymenopteran Ant Genomes as the current database for the
Pogonomyrmex ant genome, antgenomes is apparently not currently maintained.
However, when I checked the website, looks like the same transciptome data is available on this [website]() as at antgenomes; "pbar_genome.OGS.1.2.maker.transcripts.fasta". 

Using this transcript set for Illumina data simulations.


## Aphaenogaster sampling

Permit application information for PA State Forests...began process...

## Bradyrhizobium

Returned to assembly of Bradyrhizobium elkanii genomes...project that has been on the 'side' for way too long and needs to be wrapped up!

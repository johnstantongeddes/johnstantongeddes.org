Cintia Gomes de Freitas, Cristan Dambros, and I are conducting a small 'experiment' on the statistical approaches used by early career ecologists. Some more details were kindly posted by the [early career ecologists blog](https://earlycareerecologists.wordpress.com/2013/05/20/shaken-or-stirred-whats-your-method-of-choice/), as well as posted at [ecolog](https://listserv.umd.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1305d&L=ecolog-l&X=6BFF1307CD5A1638AE&Y=johnsg%40uvm.edu&P=2891).

For those of you keeping track, we've had ~~8 responses from the blog post in 3 days from the blog post~~. Update: now up to 12 responses with 5 in the past hour, which I suspect has to do with this blog cross-post on [Dynamic Ecology](http://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2013/05/24/bonus-friday-link-interesting-way-of-surveying-ecologists-preferred-statistical-approaches/), and 27 from ecolog. Either way, while the blogosphere/social networking is powerful, the old-school listserv is still way in front for recruiting volunteers.

As we're still recruiting volunteers and waiting for responses, I'll wait until later for explaining the motivations and results.

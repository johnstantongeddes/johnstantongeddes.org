Travel to [Dunn lab]() at NCSU for collecting Aphaenogaster samples for gene expression. 

Relabeled transcriptome colonies with naming scheme: 

Project name - numeric ID sorted by latitude south to north - character to differentiate colonies from same site

For example `ApGXL-01-A` is the first colony from Magnolia Springs, GA, the southernmost collected site and `ApGXL-28-B` is the second colony from Bradford Public Lands, Maine, the northernmost site collected.

Optimized protocol for heat-shocking ants from Phytotron. Protocol [here]({% post_url 2013-09-04-ApGXL-heat-shock-protocol %})

Completed about 1/3 of heat shock assays. The others will be done by NCSU group on date that colony has spent 8 weeks in phytotron. 

Gave seminar to group on Thursday. Discussion of future projects.

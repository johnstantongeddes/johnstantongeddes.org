### ApTranscriptome

Yesterday struggled with finding that some 'Bimodal' transcripts did not in fact have bimodal expression. Found that the reason for this was in this code 

~~~
exp_type = if(coef(lmout)['val'] > 0 & coef(lmout)['I(val^2)'] > 0) "High" else {
	if(coef(lmout)['val'] < 0 & coef(lmout)['I(val^2)'] < 0) "Low" else {
		if(coef(lmout)['val'] > 0 & coef(lmout)['I(val^2)'] < 0) "Intermediate" else {
			"convex"} # close else
		} # close else
	} # close else
~~~

For transcripts with overall high levels of expression, max expression at both "Low" and "High" temperatures were greater than twice the standard deviation of expression


    if(coef(lmout)['val'] < 0 & coef(lmout)['I(val^2)'] < 0) "Low"

Fixed this by requiring that max expression at both "Low" and "High" temperatures was greater than twice the standard deviation of expression *at the median temp* (19.25C)


|  &nbsp;   |  Bimodal  |  High  |  Intermediate  |  Low  |  NotExp  |
|:---------:|:---------:|:------:|:--------------:|:-----:|:--------:|
|  **A22**  |   1996    |  865   |      516       | 1913  |   290    |
|  **Ar**   |   1390    |  757   |      1508      | 1406  |   519    |

Table: Number of transcripts with maximum expression at high, low, intermediate or both high and low (bimodal) temperatures.



Correct 

|  &nbsp;   |  Bimodal  |  High  |  Intermediate  |  Low  |  NotExp  |
|:---------:|:---------:|:------:|:--------------:|:-----:|:--------:|
|  **A22**  |    353    |  941   |      516       | 3480  |   290    |
|  **Ar**   |    227    |  869   |      1508      | 2457  |   519    |

Table: Number of transcripts with maximum expression at high, low, intermediate or both high and low (bimodal) temperatures.

[Archiving Reproducible Research with R and Dataverse](http://journal.r-project.org/archive/accepted/leeper.pdf)

  - R package for achiving data and reports on [Dataverse](http://thedata.org/)
  - looks promising...but how does it compare to FigShare??

* Student Research Conference

* [Fascinating discussion of Rmarkdown on ESS list](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/ess-help/2014-March/009764.html)


### ddRADseq

**AMPure Bead Purification** of [yesterday's double-digest samples]({% post_url 2014-04-15-ddRADseq-digestion %}).

- added 75 ul AMPure Beads to the 50 ul rxn. Incubated 5 min room temp
- 2 min on magnetic plate. removed solution
- added 200 ul 70% ethanol (fresh). removed. repeat
- off plate, added 40 ul H~2~O. 1 min
- on plate 2 min. transfered solution to new plate

**Prep for ligation**

- Remade P2 adapter as biotinylated DNA key for Streptavidin step
  - 20 ul P2.1, 20 ul P2.2 (biotinylated), 10 ul 10x annealing buffer, 50 ul H~2~O
  - anneal 97.5°C for 2.5, cool to 21°C by stepping down 3°C every minute


### ApTranscriptome

Meeting with SCH, NG, AN and MK to discuss thermal reactionome manuscript.

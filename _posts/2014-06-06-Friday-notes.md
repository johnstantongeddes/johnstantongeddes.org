### ddRADseq

A third attempt at the ddRADseq protocol. 

**DNA extraction**

Completed DNA extraction that I started yesterday.

Eluted in 25ul Buffer AE. For samples 1-11, eluted twice with same buffer AE to see if this would increase yield. Reserved 2ul for Qubit.


**Double digest**

50 ul rxn volume following NEB protocol 

Reagent           Volume (ul)
---------        -------------
NlaIII                 1
MluCl                  1

CutSmart Buffer        5
H~2~O                  23 

3 hr digestion at 37Â°C.

Google scholar alert turned up a paper [An Illustrated Angiosperm Flora of Cerrado and Riparian Forest, Sao Carlos, Brazil](http://www.checklist.org.br/archive?vol=9&num=2) with location information for some Chamaecrista species in Brazil.

*CheckList* looks like a great journal - free to publish, open-access for species distribution lists.

Continuing to work on script for genomic prediction by cross-validation (see above...modifying in place). Found that gcta v1.04 crashed when I tried to calculated SNP effects, but after downloading newest version (v1.13) it worked fine.

## Aphaenogaster

Use [STAR](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/1/15.short?rss=1&amp%3bssource=mfr) for alignment of reads to transcriptome

Downloaded Pogo RNAseq data to antlab to run with Velvet/Oases.

## Bradyrhizobium

Back to assembly. Mapping to B. japonicum reference resulted in very little assembly, probably too diverged, so focus on de novo assembly using velvet. Last results using velvet about a [month ago]({% post_url 2013-04-10-wednesday %})

MUCH belatedly discovered a `-v` option for submitting batch jobs to MSI that allows passing a variables list

`qsub 04-VelvetOptimiser.pbs -v B-elkanii-genomes/velvet1/VelOpt,/home/tiffinp/stanton1/B-elkanii-genomes/fastq-shuffled/IC1_shuffled.fastq`

While thinking about Aphaenofest, found amazing resource for presentations using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). Has a very nice [web interface](https://slid.es/johnstanton-geddes). Examples and links to alternatives at this [post](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/markdown-slideshow-example-pandoc/46683)

Seems to combine best functionality of WYSIWYG design with text-based editing and reproducibility!

This is awesome - [print a cloth scientific poster](http://labhacks.tumblr.com/post/62420107780/the-25-scrunchable-scientific-poster) and stuff it in your backpack!

### ApTranscriptome

Mahesh @ VGN also working on transcriptome. They have blast2GO databases locally and may be able to do mapping and annotation.

### ApGXL

Prep for RNA extractions! 

NuGen Ovation requires only 10ng RNA per sample, so can do with single ant.

### Other things

Running blast for chagas RADseq hits against NCBI nt database for Sara. Test run with only 100 sequences

Had to download nt database first

~~~
perl update_blastdb.pl nt

for i in 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
do
	tar -xvf nt.$i.tar
done
~~~

And blast text

~~~
blastx -query test100.fasta -db nt
~~~

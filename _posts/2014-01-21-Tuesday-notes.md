* Molecular Ecologist Q&A with [Pleuni Pennings](http://www.molecularecologist.com/2014/01/people-behiind-the-science-dr-pleuni-pennings/)
* meet with Nicole to discuss DNA extractions for ApAdaPt

### ApThermBe

Talked to SparkFun Tech Support. Following recommendations, ordered for Arduino laser-trip camera:

* [Arduino Uno - R3](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11021) controller
* [TTL camera](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11610) camera
* [microSD shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9802) to store images
* [Arduino header](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10007) to attach shield to Arduino
* [Wall power supply](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8269)
* [USB cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/512) connect Arduino to computer
* [Mini photocell](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9088) laster detector
* Breadboard
* Arduino and Breadboard holder
* Resistor 10k Ohm
* Jumper wires
* Alligator clips

Still need to get laser.

Hoping that I can figure out how to put this all together...

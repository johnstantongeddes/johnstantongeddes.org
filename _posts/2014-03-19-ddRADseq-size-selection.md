As we don't have access to a Pippin-Prep, performed size selection old school by gel excision.

* Large gel 
    - 150 ul TBE
    - 2.25 g agarose
    - 7.5 ul ethidium bromide
* Loaded each sample with ladder on both sides
    - ladder
    - JSG001
    - ladder
    - JSG002
    - ladder
* Ran gel for about 2.5 hours at 120V
* Excised three gel pieces for each sample
    - 200bp: 275-300bp fragment including 76bp adapter sequence
    - 300bp: 375-400bp fragment including 76bp adapter sequence
    - 400bp: 475-500bp fragment including 76bp adapter sequence
* Extracted DNA using Qiagen QIAquick PCR Purification
    - surprised to see *a lot* of DNA in some tubes. enough to make a clear mass that partially blocked column
    - eluted in 10ul H2O and put in freezer

Note slight smear of digested DNA within sample lanes - confirms that there was DNA to excise.

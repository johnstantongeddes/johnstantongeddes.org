### ApGxL 

Sent samples from yesterday's RNA extractions for Bioanalyzer analysis to see if low quality is simply low volume, or just bad RNA extraction.

### Other

Met Grace to discuss AphThermBe project

Started review for PLoS ONE.




## Friday Jan 10

Biology seminar and meeting with Brent Lockwood.

Feed Aphaenogaster.

### ApTranscriptome

Added False Discovery Rate correction using [qvalue](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/qvalue.html) package.

Went from 10,321 with p < 0.05 to 399 transcripts with q < 0.05. 

Started annotation with FastAnnotator for Trinity_cap3_uclust.fasta

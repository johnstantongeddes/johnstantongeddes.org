Ordering ddRAD supplies with Manisha...

### ApTranscriptome

Trinity assembly completed with merged and normalized reads

Sample     Num_genes    Num_transcripts
-------   -----------  ------------------
A22          66,411         94,860
Ar           58,204         85,561
-----------------------------------------

Next 

* evaluate assembly using *in silico* spike-in reads
* reduce transcript with `uclust` and/or `CAP3`
* map reads
* `tblastx` to find orthologs
* annotation

### ApGenome

Set up final extraction with 20 *Aphaenogaster* from same colony. Extract and ship tomorrow.

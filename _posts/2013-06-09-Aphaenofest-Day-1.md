Three days of discussions about Aphaenogaster and the Climate Cascade project. After general introduction and summary of project to date, redacted comments of discussions relating to future plans. Will need to update 'open notebook' explanation to specify that for fairness to collaborators, I'm putting most of these conversation in an embargoed `\private` folder that I will make available after experiments are done.

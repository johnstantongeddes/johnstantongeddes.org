Three days of discussions about Aphaenogaster and the Climate Cascade project. After general introduction and summary of project to date, redacted comments of discussions relating to future plans. Will need to update 'open notebook' explanation to specify that for fairness to collaborators, I'm putting most of these conversation in an embargoed `\private` folder that I will make available after experiments are done.

Present at meeting:

  - Rob Dunn: NC State. interested in changes in diversity in houses (microbial and insect)
  - Sarah Diamon: postdoc NC State, starting faculty at Case Western
  - Katie Miller: staring with SCH in fall. currently working with [Tim Linksvayer](http://www.bio.upenn.edu/people/timothy-linksvayer). undergrad at U. St. Thomas with Aaron Kay
  - Clink Penick: postdoc NC State
  - Lauren Nichols: tech NC State
  - Shannon Pelini: former postdoc at NC State
  - Aaron Ellison: PI at Harvard Forest
  - Grace Barber: MS at UMass Amherst. ant diversity in Albany Pine Bush
  - Nate Sanders: PI Tennessee
  - Andrew Nguyen: UVM
  - Bernice de Marco: PhD Michigan State, phylogeny of Aphaenogaster
  - Lacy Chick: PhD at Tennessee
  - Sara Helms-Cahan: PI UVM
  - Bryan Ballif: PI UVM proteomics
  - Nick Gotelli: PI UVM
  - Josh Brown: science reporter UVM 

### Aaron Ellison - MaxEnt vs. MaxLike

  Tukey's "intraocular test": how the data hits you between the eyes
  
  Lesson: MaxEnt does not give probability of occurrence given habitat. Gives probability of habitat suitability. These are not the same. P(occurrence|habitat) != P(habitat|occurrence)

  RD: what does this mean for history of science? thousands of papers down hole
  AE: 

    - just because a GUI does not mean it should be used. 
    - biodiversity censuses should record presence/absence especially for common species. MaxLike extremely sensitive to sampling bias
    - MaxEnt is not wrong...well explained by authors. interpretation of results is incorrect given the analyses and data.


### Bryan Ballif

  - proteins: functional units of gene expression
  - proteins as biomarkers of a state, more stable than transcripts
  - harder to study proteins globally than transcriptome
  	- mass spec not inherently quantitative, better for identification
  	- sequencing nucleic acids 'easy' compared to proteins
  	- can't amplify proteins (eg PCR)

### Clint Penick

  - developmental plasticity
  
### Rob Dunn

  - adaptations to cities
  - medians as "islands"
  - unexpected ant species found in cities, often well north of known distributions e.g. Pachycondyla chinensis
  - "blind to life in cities"
  - how many crows in cities? relevant to understanding spread of West Nile virus
  - Tapinoma sessile adaptations/plasticity to city habitats (Menke 2010 PLoS1)
  - city temperatures highly heterogenous
  - Houses
    - "Wild Life of our Homes"
    - 100-120 species of arthropods per home
    - camel crickets, invasive Japanese cricket
    - microbes
    - presence of dogs can predict 50% of variance in microbe communities
    - arthropods and microbes on traditional houses in Namibia
    - 1300 houses with samples, many with health records and genome data of occupants!!!
  - online books for students
  
  Discussion of connections to Climate Cascade
  
    - in parallel with samples of ants from climate chambers, sample ants from warm and cold regions of urban environments for gene expression
    - RD suggested Raleigh for convenience. I suggested analagous sampling from Boston so we have Duke Forest - Raleigh and Harvard Forest - Boston comparisons

### Shannon Pellini

Summary of Warm Ants project

  - achieved target warming in chambers. soil temperature tracks but lags behind air temperature
  - growing degree days and soil moisture are *not* correlated
  - how is diversity related with warming at sites?
  - CTmax is associated w/density and foraging warming relationships at the low, but not the high latitude site
  - changes in density and activity under warming translate to diversity at low latitude site
  - NG: populations may be declining under warming, but because warming also increases their activity may be increasing their detectability in pitfall traps. use Chao2 estimators to attempt to control for this.
  - more species at Duke Forest than Harvard, especially rare species
  - NG: is there a change in species composition as function of growing degree days
    - null expectation is not flat due to heterogenity of species abundances. actual trend lines are more heterogenous than would be expected by chance.
  - manuscript in review: aspen seedlings with experimentally-introduced specialist aphid in warming chambers
    - presence of ants and aphids benefited plants under warming
    - pest aphid (peach aphid) invaded and had strong negative effects on plant
  - microbial community: dramatic changes at Duke Forest, little no change at Harvard Forest

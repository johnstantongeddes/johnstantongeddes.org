### ApTranscriptome

Sailfish - expression values consistent among all 10 replicates. 

Difference with previous results due to **new version of software**!

Realized this when I had to update `read.sailfish.quant` function to allow for new column, "EstimatedNumKmers". 

Three days chasing down bug...back to where I was...but inadvertent positive effect is that I *reproduced and validated* previous results! Reproducible research pays off!

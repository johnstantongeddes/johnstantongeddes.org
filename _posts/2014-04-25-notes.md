* Guide to using [make](http://kbroman.github.io/minimal_make/)

For Jekyll citations, I've been using `knitcitations` because it's the hammer I have. A more Jekyll-native tools is [Jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar). The problem is that this requires maintaining a bibtex or other reference file. See this issue for discussion of [Turning URLs into links](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar/issues/30)


### ApTranscriptome

Changed Table 1 to 4 x 4 matrix showing overlap between colonies of expression type for responsive transcripts. Visualized using mosaicplot.

  - info on [mosaic plots](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vcdExtra/vignettes/vcd-tutorial.pdf)

Working on determing *T~on~* for each transcript - the temperature at which it is turned on.

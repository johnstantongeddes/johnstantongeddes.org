Set up Zotero group [ClimateCascade](https://www.zotero.org/groups/climatecascade) for shared papers.

While looking for something else, stumbled upon [ImpactStory](http://impactstory.org/) and set up [my own account](http://impactstory.org/collection/dqm642) in about 5 minutes. Looks like some nice polish for my publications page. Great to see that my Oecologia paper is "highly cited" for a 2011 paper, with 8 citations which is greater than 83% of papers from 2011!

Working on P-value commentary.

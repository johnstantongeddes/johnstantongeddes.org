As of 11 July 2013, project name is used as "category" for organizing posts, which should allow me to keep track of which projects I'm working on over time. General posts will still fall into category `ecological genetics`. There's no consistent rule for the project name. I've tried to include the species at the front (Cf: Chamaecrista fasciculata) and then some sort of acronym capturing the project essence.

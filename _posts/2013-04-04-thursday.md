## Bradyrhizobium

1) Fastq-illumina to fastq-sanger grooming using BioPython. Got plenty of help from Brendan to get programs running

2) Fastq Quality trimming

  - Use [seqtk](https://github.com/lh3/seqtk) which may be up to 10x [faster](http://www.biostars.org/p/42462/) than fastx!

3) FastQC

Install [FastQC software](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/download.html#fastqc) from Babraham Institute for command-line usage


## Aphaenogaster

### ddRADseq

![Bioanalyzer results]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/UVMAGTC-JS-3859_Cahan-4-22-2014_DNA_1000_DE20901668_2014-04-22_08-45-23.pdf )

Discouraging - *no* DNA in the pooled samples that *should* have DNA. There is low-level DNA in the ligated samples - actually less than after the double digestion. 

Potential problems: 

- low recovery from AMPure purification during pooling
- low recovery from gel purification

Though I couldn't find anything specific about percent DNA recovery following AMPure bead purification on Beckman Coulter's website, this [awesome lab page](http://www.keatslab.org/blog/pcrpurificationampureandsimple) gave results showing about 70% recovery with 1.4 - 1.6 bead ratio. Seems okay.

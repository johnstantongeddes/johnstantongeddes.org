### ApTranscriptome

Continuing working on analysis. 

### ApGXL

To check quality of RNA after RNAzol extraction only, diluted the 2ul aliquots from [yesterday's extractions]({% post_url 2014-01-13-RNA-extraction %}) 10x. Sent 2 ul for Bioanalyzer analysis (Pico range 200 pg/ul - 25 ng/ul).

If quality of DNA is adequate and concentration is not *much* lower, there should be enough RNA in the remaining 15-18 ul for DGE.

Also did a new round of RNA extraction *through RNAzol only* but different than yesterday:

* all ethanol washes
* elute in 102 ul H2O

Table: RNAzol extraction

| Sample    | RNAzol ng/ul | RNAzol 260/280 | BioAn ng/ul | BioAn RIN |
|-----------|:------------:|:--------------:|:-----------:|:---------:|
| 20D CT    | 	  157.8	   |		1.8		|	0		  |	    5.9   |
| 20D HS	|	   26.0	   |	 	1.6		|	0		  |	    1.2   |
| 24A CT	|    lost	   |	  	-	 	| 	-		  |	    -     |
| 24A HS	|     79.9	   |	  	1.7	 	| 	0		  |	    1   |

Given the greater elution volume, these values are on par with yesterday's results.

Diluted these sample 10x and sent for Bioanalyzer (Pico range 200 pg/ul - 25 ng/ul) along with other samples.

**UPDATE**: 2014-01-15 added Bioanalyzer results. Terrible - shouln't have diluted as any signal disappeared.

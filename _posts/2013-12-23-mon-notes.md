Holiday week! Feeding ants today and Friday.

### ApTranscriptome

Wrote function `rename.trinity.transcripts` to rename transcripts generated from Trinity after assembling with CAP3. More complicated than I orginally though as I had to 

* rename both
  - CAP3 assembled contigs with header `Contig1` 
  - CAP3 singlets with format `>comp77763_c0_seq1 len=213 path=[102682384:0-212]`
* maintain alternative transcript (seq) information from trinity
  - >comp118_c0_seq1 len=230 path=[42071:0-80 42152:81-229]
  - >comp118_c0_seq2 len=207 path=[42600:0-57 42152:58-206]
* while allowing for over 100 (wtf???) alternative transcripts in some cases


### Computing

While pandoc is great, the default options to generate a pdf from markdown are terrible. Wrote a script `md2pdf` that provides some useful options to pandoc to improve pdf output. For this and other useful scripts, created a "toolbox" directory and [repository on github](https://github.com/johnstantongeddes/toolbox).

Added a number of R script and latex templates to this repository.

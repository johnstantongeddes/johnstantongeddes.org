### Samples

DNA was extracted from 3 ants each from 6 lab colonies of *Aphaenogaster*.

Combined total DNA ~ 1.0384 &times; 10<sup>4</sup> ng 

### Double digestion

50 ul rxn volume following NEB protocol 

Reagent           Volume (ul)
---------        -------------
NlaIII                 1

CutSmart Buffer        5
H~2~O                  4

3 hr digestion at 37Â°C.

Included "T7" Control sample of dH~2~O only.

* Ln 1, Ap001, is genomic DNA. Note smear above largest marker and no/very little DNA within assay range.

* Ln 2 - 6 are double-digested samples. Looks like digest worked well for all samples as concentration in the 180 - 220 bp window ranged from 0.84 - 3.64 ng/ul. 


### AMPure Bead Purification

- added 75 ul AMPure Beads to the 50 ul rxn. Incubated 5 min room temp
- 2 min on magnetic plate. removed solution
- added 200 ul 70% ethanol (fresh). removed. repeat
- off plate, added 40 ul H~2~O. 1 min
- on plate 2 min. transfered solution to new plate

Quantified DNA using Qubit.

* DNA recovery is low, only 20.7674% on average.
* Positive correlation between the input DNA and DNA after digestion.
* T7 is the blank control - note low-level DNA contamination.

**Ligation**

Input 100 ng total DNA from each sample for ligation. Volume of each sample to use as input for ligation reaction:

Sample        Volume DNA (ul)      
--------    --------------  
T1               9.2 
T2               4.0 
T3              19.3 
T4               9.8  
T5              17.2  
T6              47.6  
T7              40.0 

<br>

For each sample, combined DNA with adapter and T4 ligase. Determined concentration of adapters using [ligation molarity calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ar5IymziRJ_9dEtyYzRfd0cteDc1cEM1ekN5M1doZEE&usp=drive_web#gid=0). Made fresh working stock of the universal adapter P2. Rather than make a working stock for each adapter P1, just used 0.5 ul of adapters P1.1 - P1.7 for samples T1 - T7, respectively. Made master mix of universal adapter P2 following worksheet.

### Size selection

* Pooled 40 ul of each ligation in single 1.5 ml tube, leaving ~ 10 ul for diagnostics.
* AMPure bead purification - modified rack method using 96-well magnet plate
  - Total pool volume 320 ul. 
  - 480 ul AMPure beads
  - Two washes with 500 ul 70% EtOH
  - Eluted in 30 ul H~2~O
* Size selection
  - ran gel for 2.5 hrs at 120V.
  - To size select (1) 200+-20 bp, (2) 300+-20 bp, (3) 400 +- 20bp, had to account for 76 bp of adapter sequence. Cut gel pieces 250 - 300 bp, 350 - 400 bp, 450 - 500 bp
  
#![Diagram of gel size selection. Dotted boxes show gel slices cut for size selection.]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/gel_size_selection.png)

  - QIAquick purification, eluting in 12 ul H~2~O

|    P1    | Pooled - size 200 |  0.18  |
|    P2    | Pooled - size 300 |   0    |
|    P3    | Pooled -size 400  |  0.01  |

**Very little to no DNA in each pooled size selection.**

Possible places DNA lost

* pooling
* gel extraction

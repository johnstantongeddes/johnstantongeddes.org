### Aphaenophone conference call

1. Manuscripts

  - NG and JSG submitted "Next-generation species distribution models" to Ecology 
  - JSG: Aphaenogaster thermal reactionome in prep for PNAS
  - CP: adding all 14 species from Phytotron to comparative development paper, in prep
  - BBdM: revisions of Novomessor manuscript
  - LC: SDM manuscript, using thermal traits and probability of occurrence

2. Update on genetic data (JSG + SCH)

  - first 48 samples of ddRADseq for population genetics off Illumina machine, will start processing data soon
  - DGE RNAseq protocol working for the Phytotron samples to get gene expression
  - ants on hand to extract DNA for Aphaenogaster picea genome sequencing
  - **with both popgen and RNAseq protocols working, we can think about what other samples it would be useful to have this data for**

3. Update on Phytotron vouchers (CP)

  - about 4 colonies missing vouchers from Phytotron. may have these at VT 
  - almost all samples north of PA are A. picea, but south of PA is a mix of A. picea, rudis, fulva, carolinensis

4. New field collections (AN + KM)
  - KM: collected 10 colonies from each of three sites: VT, PA, NC. Will use to look at shifts in stoichiometry from field to lab
  - AN: collected 81 colonies from 10-13 species over summer. currently measuring knock-down temperature for each colony, and collecting ant samples at 10 time points during ramp for gene expression work

5. Other topics

  - SCH: need to collect samples from chambers on hot and cool days
    - LN: already made cool day collection at DF, waiting for hot day
  - ML: working on network analysis with AE and others
  - ML: taking over pitfalls in the chambers at HF
  - SCH: collect larvae from nest boxes when iButtons are removed in October.

Lacy will organize the next call on September 4th.

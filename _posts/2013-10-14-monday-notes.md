### ApTranscriptome

Even with 72hr walltime on mason - velvet assembly *still* crashed. 

### Meeting with Jeanne Harris

reseach plan discussion - full details embargoed

### Zotero

Followed directions [here](https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/5094/) to allow drag-and-drop functionality for copying Zotero references in latex (\citep) format to a text editor.

> If you don't know where your translator's directory is: go to Zotero Preferences. Open the Advanced pane. Click on "Show Data Directory." This will take you to a "zotero" folder. The "zotero" folder will contain a "translators" folder. Save the.BibtexCiteKeyOnly.js file here. 
>
> Instructions:
> After you restart Zotero, you can use the drag and drop functionality by going to the "Export" preferences pane and choosing "BibTex CiteKey-Only Exporter" as the Default Output Format. Now, you can select a reference and drag it off the screen into a waiting text editor. Alternatively you can use Cmd+Shift+C to copy the \Cite{key} to your clipboard.

With the newest translator which was [available](http://pastebin.com/UNVexqKc). 

Some [more tips](http://someonehasdonethis.blogspot.com/2012/11/using-zotero-with-bibtex.html) on changing the citation key and such.

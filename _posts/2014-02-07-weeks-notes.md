Yikes - to celebrate the approach of the year anniversary of my open lab notebook I let a month slip by without updates. During this time I've been cranking on all cylinders as well as dealing with home business. Finally taking the time to transcribe my notes from this time to digital.


## 2014-02-03

* Working on presentation for EcoLunch. Using [slidify](http://slidify.org/)
* Biology seminar - Jessica Hellman
* Meeting w/Jessica
    - discussed ecological genomics and my results
  
### ApTranscriptome

Given strong correlations in expression, should analyze expression on colonies together!

### Computing

* Statistics in python: [statsmodels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/devel/index.html)
* Plotting in python: [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

    

## 2014-02-04

* Continuing work on EcoLunch
* Meeting with Tim Hunter at Microarray facility
    - for RNA samples, should check with Qubit given inconsistent Nanodrop and Bioanalyzer results
    - look at Nanodrop traces - is there salt contamination?
    - DGE - Covaris sonicator for DNA fragmentation at library prep stage
    - RADseq - Caliper XT for size selection. or do gel extraction
* meet with Grace - feed Pogos

### ApAdaPt

Performed AmPure Bead PCR Purification on double digest DNA samples. 
300ul round bottom PCR plates sit on top of magnetic plate. Beads make ring at bottom. 
Easy and quick protocol.


## 2014-02-07

Working all week on EcoLunch presentation. 

Developed *shiny* R web app to display expression levels of specific transcripts by search term. Slick.


### EcoLunch

Transcriptome presentation!

### CCThermBe

Grace observed colony for about 40 minutes - observed 35 blue (heat-shocked) and only 7 red (control) ants foraging!

### ApTranscriptome

Confirmed that RSEM and sailfish expression values are highly correlated, and that expression values are correlated between temperature levels for both colonies.

Re-run of script identifies *unique* set of responsive transcripts. Must have been bug in the sailfish step that caused duplication problems. Now fixed!

Updated and merged branch to use `ddply` instead of `for` loop.

### Dimensions meeting

- quadratic term seems to mostly be due to genes that are non-linearly decreasing or increasing expression
- focus on these *linear* patterns by splitting the data into 'low' and 'high' temperature groups
    - 0 -- 17.5 C
    - 17.5 -- 38.5C
- fit linear model with *linear* term only. 
- two sets of genes
    - increase expression with increasing temp
    - increase expression with decreasing temp
- compare overall expression (intercept) between two colonies

KM report

- has data on C:N:P for ant pupae

* still working on script to run `blastn` efficiently for Chagas RAD-tags...

### CCThermBe

Heat-shocked one group (blue) of ants for 1 hour at 42C. Red group kept in tubes at room temp.

### ApTranscriptome

Mahesh sent RSEM output for the "Trinity_cap3_uclust.fasta" assembly. 

*Within* both data sets, expression values are highly correlated between colonies, ~~but *between* data sets, there is NO correlation...how can this be???~~  

UPDATE - transcripts were ordered differently. when `merge`ed, correlations > 0.94 between RSEM and sailfish expression values.

Correlations *between* colonies at each temperature level are also high, > 0.9 for all temperatures
except 7.5 C

### ApAdaPt

NlaIII - MluCl double digest for 6 DNA samples. 

Made a worksheet to calculate reaction volumes available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ar5IymziRJ_9dHJMaHViLXRmSjdibUszY3gyb2dEamc&usp=drive_web).

=====================

Repository for my website and open lab notebook.  

This website is built using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

The inspiration and design is explained in my first lab notebook entry [here](http://johnstantongeddes.org/open%20science/2013/03/13/first-post.html).

Briefly, I acknowledge [Charlie Geyer](http://users.stat.umn.edu/~geyer/) for prosthelytizing 'reproducible research' while 
I was working on my PhD, the people at [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) for making it 
possible, and [Carl Boettiger](http://carlboettiger.info/) for providing tools to put it all together.

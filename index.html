title: ecological genetics and genomics
---

<section class="">
	<p> My research is focused on understanding contemporary evolution in natural populations. What constrains species from expanding their ranges? How do species interactions influence adaptive evolution and community structure? What is the genetic basis of adaptation? I approach these questions using field studies, population genetics, genomics and experimental quantitative genetics. While a field biologist at heart, I enjoy statistical genetics and am an <a href="www.r-project.org">R</a> enthusiast. You can learn more about my <a href="research.html">research and publications here</a>.</p>

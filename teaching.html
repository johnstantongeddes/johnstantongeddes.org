<section class="">
	<p> I'm passionate about teaching ecology and evolution for two reasons. First, the natural world is a fascinating place! Second, responding to the grand challenges (e.g. climate change, disease) we face in the 21st century <em>requires</em> a better understanding of evolution and ecology. I've been involved in teaching biology at all age levels for over 10 years. My first job out of college was teaching K-12 students about nature at <a href="http://www.ranchoelchorro.org/">Rancho El Chorro Outdoor School.</a> Since then, I've taught labs at the University of Minnesota, lectured at Macalester College, and recently I was a <a href="http://citizenscience.bard.edu/faculty/faculty.php">faculty</a> member of the <a href="http://citizenscience.bard.edu">Citizen Science</a> program at Bard College. </p>

	<p> Students in my courses develop creative thinking skills in group-based activities, while learning core concepts through active lectures. In addition, students practice the crucial skills of effective communication through writing and alternative media. My reseach and teaching are intertwined as I have mentored students on independent research projects, leading to publication in peer-reviewed ecology journals (Stanton-Geddes and Anderson, 2011).</p>

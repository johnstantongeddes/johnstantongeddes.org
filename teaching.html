	<p> Education is fundamental to a student`s personal development and their engagement in our society and environment. Teachers have a critical role in this formation. My goals as a teacher are that students (1) develop the ability to think critically about complexity and (2) learn how to effectively communicate about this complexity in order to enrich their own lives and contribute to solving global challenges. Accomplishing these goals requires understanding the diversity of students and their learning styles, and engaging students in the learning process. While my teaching is focused on understanding complexity in the natural world, the skills I teach will transfer to all careers and generate life-long learning. </p>

	<p> To achieve my teaching goals, I use active lecturing and problem-based learning to foster a positive learning environment that respects each student and their needs. Active lecturing (see box) is a key component in my teaching for efficiently transferring knowledge to students, emphasizing key points that may be overlooked in casual skimming of textbooks. However, lecturing alone can fail to achieve engagement from all students. I motivate students to want the information presented in lecture through problem-based learning. Students develop critical thinking skills by solving real-world problems presented in class. By working in teams, they also develop collaborative skills and complement each others' strengths and weaknesses. Most importantly, by coming to knowledge through the process of discovery, students retain more information and are better prepared to apply their knowledge and skills to future learning.</p>	

	<p> I also aim to help students develop effective communication skills through my courses. Teaching effective communication skills requires more than having students write lab reports; it demands student engagement in the process of developing an idea, writing drafts, making and receiving feedback, revising and producing a final work. Collaborative learning is an integral part of this process, as I use peer feedback groups to engage students in the process of writing, editing and rewriting. Moreover, I include presentations and opportunities for online visual media (e.g. youtube videos explaining research projects) to emphasize other aspects of science communication.</p>

	<p> I'm passionate about teaching ecology and evolution for two reasons. First, the natural world is a fascinating place! Second, responding to the grand challenges (e.g. climate change, disease) we face in the 21st century <em>requires</em> a better understanding of evolution and ecology. I've been involved in teaching biology at all age levels for over 10 years, from K-12 students at <a href="http://www.ranchoelchorro.org/">Rancho El Chorro Outdoor School</a> to Citizen Science students at <a href="http://citizenscience.bard.edu">Bard College</a>. </p>

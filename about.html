<section class="">
	<p> I was born in Toulouse, France which likely explains my predilection for blue cheese and red wine. I then lived in Kansas City and St. Louis, before moving off to Amherst, Massachusetts for college. This was where I discovered plant ecology and evolution in the lab of <a href="https://www3.amherst.edu/~jsmiller/Lab/Miller_Lab_Home.html">Dr. Jill Miller</a>. My undergraduate work was on the mating systems of <i>Lobelia</i> species in Massachusetts. I spent a few years in central California, teaching K-12 students at Rancho El Chorro Outdoor School near San Luis Obispo, and then selling 'bugs' for biological insect control at <a href="http://www.rinconvitova.com"> Rincon-Vitova Insectaries</a> in Ventura, where I learned plenty about organic farming before beginning graduate school in the Department of Ecology, Evolution and Behavior at the University of Minnesota. I'm now located in Burlington, VT, the middle of the amazing Champlain Valley, where I enjoy all things outdoors with my wife and daughter. </p>
